  Repo for the  submission of the course project for the Johns Hopkins Getting and Cleaning  Data course.<br>
  <strong>Overview</strong><br>
  This project serves to  demonstrate the collection and cleaning of a tidy data set that can be used for  subsequent analysis. A full description of the data used in this project can be  found at&nbsp;<a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones">The UCI Machine  Learning Repository</a> <br>

  <strong>Project Summary</strong><br>
  The following is a  summary description of the project instructions<br>
  You should create one  R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
  <li>Merges       the training and the test sets to create one data set.</li>
  <li>Extracts       only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each       measurement.</li>
  <li>Uses       descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set</li>
  <li>Appropriately       labels the data set with descriptive activity names.</li>
  <li>Creates       a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for       each activity and each subject.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Additional Information</strong><br>
  You can find  additional information about the variables, data and transformations in the  CodeBook.MD file.</p>
